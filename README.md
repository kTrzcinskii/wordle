# Wordle
Copy of a popular game *worlde* created in c++ as a terminal program.

## It uses 2 custom classes that I built:
 - Terminal Manager -> it's responsible for taking care of terminal's appearance
 - Wordle -> there is a logic behind the whole game.
 
## Play
If you want to check it out, clone the repo, build the `src` directory and just type
```
./wordle
```

**Remember to put `/res` directory in directory with your built program!**
 
 *It's a simple project that help me get to know c++ a little bit better :)*
